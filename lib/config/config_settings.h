/*
 * MACROS:
 * - define a configuration section:
 *   cfg_section(id, name, parent, flags, since_version, deprecated_since_version, deprecation_comment, comment)
 *
 * - define a configuration setting of simple type:
 *   cfg(id, name, parent, flags, type, default_value, since_version, unconfigured_default_value, deprecated_since_version, deprecation_comment, comment)
 *
 * - define a configuration array of one or more types:
 *   cfg_array(id, name, parent, flags, types, default_value, since_version, unconfigured_default_value, deprecated_since_version, deprecation_comment, comment)
 *
 *
 * If default value can't be assigned statically because it depends on some
 * run-time checks or if it depends on other settings already defined,
 * the configuration setting  or array can be defined with the
 * "{cfg|cfg_array}_runtime" macro. In this case the  default value
 * is evaluated by automatically calling "get_default_<id>" function.
 * See config.h and "function types to evaluate default value at runtime".
 *
 *
 * VARIABLES:
 * 
 * id:                         Unique identifier.
 *
 * name:                       Configuration node name.
 *
 * parent:                     Id of parent configuration node.
 *
 * flags:                      Configuration item flags:
 *                                 CFG_NAME_VARIABLE - configuration node name is variable
 *                                 CFG_ALLOW_EMPTY - node value can be emtpy
 *                                 CFG_ADVANCED - this node belongs to advanced config set
 *                                 CFG_UNSUPPORTED - this node is not officially supported and it's used primarily by developers
 *                                 CFG_PROFILABLE - this node is customizable by a profile
 *                                 CFG_PROFILABLE_METADATA - profilable and attachable to VG/LV metadata
 *                                 CFG_DEFAULT_UNDEFINED - node's default value is undefined (depends on other system/kernel values outside of lvm)
 *                                 CFG_DEFAULT_COMMENTED - node's default value is commented out on output
 *                                 CFG_DISABLED - configuration is disabled (defaults always used)
 *                                 CFG_FORMAT_INT_OCTAL - print integer number in octal form (also prefixed by "0")
 *
 * type:		       Allowed type for the value of simple configuation setting, one of:
 *                                 CFG_TYPE_BOOL
 *                                 CFG_TYPE_INT
 *                                 CFG_TYPE_FLOAT
 *                                 CFG_TYPE_STRING
 *
 * types:                      Allowed types for the values of array configuration setting
 *                             (use logical "OR" to define more than one allowed type,
 *                             e.g. CFG_TYPE_STRING | CFG_TYPE_INT).
 *
 * default_value:              Default value of type 'type' for the configuration node,
 *                             if this is an array with several 'types' defined then
 *                             default value is a string where each string representation
 *                             of each value is prefixed by '#X' where X is one of:
 *                                 'B' for boolean value
 *                                 'I' for integer value
 *                                 'F' for float value
 *                                 'S' for string value
 *                                 '#' for the '#' character itself
 *                             For example, "#Sfd#I16" means default value [ "fd", 16 ].
 *
 * since_version:              The version this configuration node first appeared in (be sure
 *                             that parent nodes are consistent with versioning, no check done
 *                             if parent node is older or the same age as any child node!)
 *                             Use "vsn" macro to translate the "major.minor.release" version
 *                             into a single number that is being stored internally in memory.
 *                             (see also lvmconfig ... --withversions)
 *
 * unconfigured_default_value: Unconfigured default value used as a default value which is
 *                             in "@...@" form and which is then substitued with concrete value
 *                             while running configure.
 *                             (see also 'lvmconfig --type default --unconfigured')
 *
 * deprecated_since_version:   The version since this configuration node is deprecated.
 *
 * deprecation_comment:        Comment about deprecation reason and related info (e.g. which
 *                             configuration is used now instead).
 *
 * comment:                    Comment used in configuration dumps. The very first line is the
 *                             summarizing comment.
 *                             (see also lvmconfig ... --withcomments and --withsummary)
 *
 *
 * Difference between CFG_DEFAULT_COMMENTED and CFG_DEFAULT_UNDEFINED:
 *
 * UNDEFINED is only used if the value depends on other
 * system/kernel values outside of lvm.  The most common
 * case is when dm-thin or dm-cache have built-in default
 * settings in the kernel, and lvm will use those built-in
 * default values unless the corresponding lvm config setting
 * is set.
 *
 * COMMENTED is used to comment out the default setting in
 * lvm.conf.  The effect is that if the LVM version is
 * upgraded, and the new version of LVM has new built-in
 * default values, the new defaults are used by LVM unless
 * the previous default value was set (uncommented) in lvm.conf.
